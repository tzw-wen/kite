The RawDistiller.exe was an application working on Windows platforms to process .raw files generated by HPLC-MS systems from Thermo Fisher Scientific.  The outputs could
be .ms2, .mgf and .mzXML files.

The RawSnapper.exe was another Windows application to process .raw files and generate .pdf files from the chromatograms.

This application was part of the kite pipeline developed by Tim Wen. 

The kite scheduler of the kite pipeline run on Linux platforms.  The kite client application accepted .ms2 files and distributed MS/MS searches into kite servers and generated .sqt files.

The .sqt files were inputs for swallow.exe (a Linux application) in kitelinux folder.

The sandmartin.exe in kitelinux folder was another Linux application.  It used the DTAelect/Contrast to compile hundreds of experiments into one projects. 
Please install DTASelect and put DTASelect and Contrast in your PATH.

The noddy.exe of the kite pipeline used the outputs from sandmartin.exe to finish label-free quantitation, TMT Quantitation and protein complex cross-link identification. 
The noddy.exe was a Windows application so that it could use Microsoft EXCEL to generate .xlsx outputs.

Please use bash for all linux commands in kite pipeline.

The swallow.exe could also use TPP and percolator for fdr control. Please install their commands into the Linux64 folder.

Please read the README-TPP.txt and percolator-license.txt for the licenses.

Please read the README in libsvm for libsvm.

Please use the command ldd SQTMassFixer to check the common libraries are available in your linux system.

The boost libraries were included with it license.
